  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', opts = {} },
  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
